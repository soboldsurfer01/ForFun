	<h2>Favorite Interest</h2>
		<p>
			<span class="resort"> Warhammer 40k</span> is by far my favorite hobby/interest. I originally started out investing in miniatures
			to play the table top game.  The things I enjoy most about 40k are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Painting Miniatures</li>
			<li>The Lore</li>
			<li>The Science Fiction</li>
			<li>Reading the Books</li>
			<li>Playing the tabletop game and videogame versions</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>
			<span class="resort"> Warhammer 40k</span> is set 39,000 years in the future.  Humanity has expanded across the stars and
			conquered most of the Milky Way Galaxy.  To do so they have created a new type of super soldier, Space Marines, that are genetically
			modified to fight wars that normal humans can't.  Humanity comes close to finishing their great conquest until their greatest general,
			Horus Lupercal turns on the Imperium of Man and wages the bloodiest civil war imaginable.
		</p>

		<p>
			Based off of a table top game designed in the 80's, Warhammer 40k has exploded in popularity and can be found in all parts of the world.
			It includes miniatures, books, videogames and movies.  The game features several prominent races that an enthusiast can choose to build an
			army from.  The most popular races include Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Eldar, Orks, Chaos Forces, and Tyranids.  Models and Codex (Books
			with Army specific information) can be purchased and painted to be able to play the table top version of the game. 
			<a href = "https://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Warhammer-40-000">Games Workshop</a> is the original founding company that designs and
			sells the miniatures, however they can be purchased from local hoby shops as well.
