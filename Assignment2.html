		  <div><p style = "font-size:18px;"> The Blood Angels are the IX Legion Astartes of the original 20 preheresy legions.  Their Primarch is Sanguinius the "Angel". 
				Their homeworld is Baal a red rust desert covered planet.  The Legion is one of the longest lasting, with some of the greatest
				heraldry and one of my favorite primarchs.  They suffer from a genetic disease that makes them go crazy and were one of the few legions
				present to defend Terra during the Siege of Terra.  They are one of the most popular legions in the franchise, favoring a combination
				of raw savegery and noble penance, and have faced many major threats throughout their long history including the Tyranids, forces of Chaos
				and the Eldar to name a few.</p>
